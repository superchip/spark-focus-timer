# Spark Focus Timer – Store Listing Draft

## Short Description (132 char max)
Minimal focus & break timer that shows inspirational quotes, facts & discoveries on breaks. No tracking. Stay sharp.

## Long Description
Spark is a lightweight Pomodoro-style focus timer that turns breaks into uplifting micro‑discoveries. Instead of drifting into distractions, enjoy a quick dose of curiosity or inspiration – then get back to deep work.

### What Makes Spark Different
- Intentional Breaks: You manually start breaks (no surprise tab spam)
- Inspiring Content: Facts, quotes, curated sites, optional NASA imagery
- Reliable Background Engine: Timer continues even if popup is closed
- Smart Notifications: Action buttons let you jump straight into the next session
- Privacy First: No analytics, no tracking scripts, no accounts

### Features
- Focus / Short Break / Long Break cycle (custom durations)
- Daily stats: completed sessions, total focus time, streak
- Random break content from enabled categories
- Options page with instant auto-save
- Optional NASA API key support for higher API quota
- Debug Console (opt‑in) for testers and power users

### Privacy & Data
Spark stores everything locally using Chrome extension storage. No browsing history, no external telemetry, nothing sold or shared. Only outbound network calls are to the public APIs you enable (facts, quotes, NASA APOD) plus any curated site you explicitly open.

### Permissions Explained
- storage: Save timer state, statistics, preferences
- alarms: Run focus/break timers reliably in the background
- notifications: Let you know when a session completes (can disable)
- host permissions: Restricted to the small set of API domains for content

### Roadmap (Planned)
- Optional sound cues
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Basic theming / light mode
- Exportable stats
